# barf

**barf is an extremely minimal blog generator.**

The entire build script is less than 100 lines of shell.

It could almost be called "suckless", but probably isn't. It was created for those focused on writing, not tinkering.

You can learn more by reading the [official README](https://git.sr.ht/~bt/barf) and view the generated [Atom feed here](/atom.xml)

**barf** = blogs are really fun
