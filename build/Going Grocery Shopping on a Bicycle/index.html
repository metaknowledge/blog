<h1>Going Grocery Shopping on a Bicycle</h1>
<p>2025-01-16</p>
<p>I've got a car. I had a car for about 4 months now, and I never drive it. For reference I'm currently in college in seattle. Its so easy to take a bus or use the light rail to get places that I didn't have a car for three years. The only time I was in a car was to go skiing on the weekends in winter. Even then it wasn't my car it was someone else's, and the only reason I got one was so I could be that person carpooling my friends up to the mountain. 
Getting groceries are a challenge without a car. Most grocery stores are not built for people to walk or bike up to, even in seattle. Riding a bike has helped me in ways I wasn't expecting. For one I buy less because I can only fit so much in a 40 litre backpack (I recommend a hiking backpack from rei). I also don't drink as much milk anymore because hauling a gallon or half gallon of milk is heavy.</p>
