<h1>Gmail Labels are Not Great</h1>
<p>2024-04-12</p>
<p>I recently read a blog post <em><a href="https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags">Fuck trees, use tags</a></em>. Which compares the use of tags verses tree as a way to sort files, and in the article the author gives the example of Gmail as a tag system mimicking a tree. However, I don't think Gmail handles tags well. I preface that I am not an expert in tag or tree but I don't need to be a chef to know when the food tastes bad. 
<h2>What Gmail does good</h2>
<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>I will complement Google on the filtering system. Every time you search in gmail you have the option to convert that search into a filter with actions such as mark it as read, star it, forward it, and most importantly apply a label to it. I use this all the time, some of the filters that I have (which can be found in Settings &gt; Filter and Blocked Addresses) are
<ul>
<li>people using my school's email address</li>
<li>family member's emails</li>
<li>mailing lists</li>
<li>taxes</li>
<li>amazon
Filters also make it so I don't forget to label an email.
<h3>Inbox as a label</h3>
<p>The inbox in gmail is a label and works just like any other label. So when an email arrives its tagged with "inbox".
<h3>Colors</h3>
<p>I can choose a label color and I makes it so I can get some sense of what the email is without having to read the email. I have a label "!!!NEEDSMYATTENTION" for very important email and its colored red so I feel some urgency to deal with it. It also is sort.
<h3>Hiding Label if there no unread</h3>
<p>Under Settings &gt; Labels, I can set labels to hide from the left labels bar if there is no unread mail with that label. I love this because I can hide labels that are not important and keep ones that I use for quickly finding important emails.
<h2>What Gmail does Bad</h2>
<h3>Sublabels</h3>
<p>They are not recursive. Let's say I have the tags:
<pre>
└── Taxes
  └── Pay Stubs
      └── W-2
  └── IRS
</pre>
Now I get an email of a W-2 form from my work, I label it with the W-2 Label. But it's not labeled with W-2 its labeled [Taxes/Pay Stubs/W-2]. Ok that fine a bit long but it works. Now I go click on the Taxes tab so I can look at all my Tax related emails, but my W-2 form is not there. Why? because labels are not recursive. So I label it Taxes and Pay Stub, but now Gmail formats it as [Taxes][Taxes/Pay Stubs][Taxes/Pay Stubs/W-2]. 
Its ultimately my prefrence because I look at labels as Tags</p>
