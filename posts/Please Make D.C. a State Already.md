# Please Make D.C. a state already

2024-05-12

I'm from Washington State, but see how I had to specify "state" instead of saying Washington. I hate reading "from Washington" only to discover that the author is implying Washington D.C. I don't care if we will have an odd number of stars on the flag. It doesn't matter what its name is, although it will probably be name Lincoln or Jefferson.
