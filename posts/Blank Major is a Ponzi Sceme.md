# Blank Major is a Ponzi Scheme

2025-05-19

I heard this yesterday from an amath major talking about pure math. I've heard this online about almost every major, but most of it is at the humanities. I think this is some real stupid shit. It promotes anti-intellectualism. Can't we just learn things for the sake of learning things? If a person has a real interest in learning Latin even though its a dead language they should still go for it. Good things do come out of people learning a dead language. Certain (conservative) people think that a major has to be useful to be valuable. We don't need things to have a purpose to learn about them. Just because engineering can make shit doesn't make English majors any less important. Honestly majors like psychology are more important that aerospace engineering because they're not about to go off and design missiles.
Anyone who says stuff like this is trying to demoralize people about higher education. Learning stuff is good.
