# Blank Major is a Ponzi Scheme

2025-05-19

I heard this yesterday from an amath major talking about about pure math. I've heard this online almost about every major, but most of the talk is about humanities. I think this is some real stupid shit. It promotes anti-intellectualism. Can't we just learn things for the sake of learning things? If a person has a real interest in learning Latin even though its a dead language they should still follow that interest. Good things do come out of people learning a dead language, but we don't even need things to have a purpose to learn about them. Just because engineering can make shit doesn't make English majors any less important. Honestly majors like psychology are more important that aerospace engineering because their not about to go design missiles.
Anyone who says stuff like this is trying to demoralize people about higher education. Learning this is good.
