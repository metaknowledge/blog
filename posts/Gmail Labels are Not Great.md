# Gmail Labels are Not Great

2024-04-12

I recently read a blog post *[Fuck trees, use tags](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-04-02-fuck-trees-use-tags)*. Which compares the use of tags verses tree as a way to sort files, and in the article the author gives the example of Gmail as a tag system mimicking a tree. However, I don't think Gmail handles tags well. I preface that I am not an expert in tag or tree but I don't need to be a chef to know when the food tastes bad. 
## What Gmail does good
### Filters
I will complement Google on the filtering system. Every time you search in gmail you have the option to convert that search into a filter with actions such as mark it as read, star it, forward it, and most importantly apply a label to it. I use this all the time, some of the filters that I have (which can be found in Settings > Filter and Blocked Addresses) are
- people using my school's email address
- family member's emails
- mailing lists
- taxes
- amazon
Filters also make it so I don't forget to label an email.
### Inbox as a label
The inbox in gmail is a label and works just like any other label. So when an email arrives its tagged with "inbox".
### Colors
I can choose a label color and I makes it so I can get some sense of what the email is without having to read the email. I have a label "!!!NEEDSMYATTENTION" for very important email and its colored red so I feel some urgency to deal with it. It also is sort.
### Hiding Label if there no unread
Under Settings > Labels, I can set labels to hide from the left labels bar if there is no unread mail with that label. I love this because I can hide labels that are not important and keep ones that I use for quickly finding important emails.
## What Gmail does Bad
### Sublabels
They are not recursive. Let's say I have the tags:
<pre>
└── Taxes
    └── Pay Stubs
        └── W-2
    └── IRS
</pre>
Now I get an email of a W-2 form from my work, I label it with the W-2 Label. But it's not labeled with W-2 its labeled \[Taxes/Pay Stubs/W-2]. Ok that fine a bit long but it works. Now I go click on the Taxes tab so I can look at all my Tax related emails, but my W-2 form is not there. Why? because labels are not recursive. So I label it Taxes and Pay Stub, but now Gmail formats it as \[Taxes]\[Taxes/Pay Stubs]\[Taxes/Pay Stubs/W-2]. 
Its ultimately my prefrence because I look at labels as Tags
