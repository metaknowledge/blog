# AI Voice

2024-09-13

My highschool freshman english teacher said something about my writing that I think a lot about. He discussed how each person has a voice in their writing, and that he can tell whose paper he is reading by the voice in the words. I often think about my own voice, and how its changed as I've grown up, or how it changes when I write texts, emails, or papers. 
The thing that scared my the most is when my teacher said that he could tell if someone else help us write our paper because the voice of the words changed. Relating to AI I think that if someone uses AI to write the the voice of that writing must change. There was a study done on research papers that found the use of "delve" to be higher in newer papers because chat-gpt uses "delve" more frequently because it was trained on skewed data. I have completely dropped the word "delve" from my vocabulary because I fear that someone might use it to show that I wrote a paper with AI. 
I wonder if my english teacher can tell if someone wrote a their paper with AI.
