# PirateSoftware the is summation of the internet

I really admire Thor. Everything about his personality, hobbies, and just general advice I feel is the summation of years on the internet. We live in a time where you can find expert advice on anything, and I've always had a question, "What happens if I followed all the good advice on the internet". I think that Thor is the answer to that.
