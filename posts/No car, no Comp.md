# No Car, No Comp

2024-07-21

I recently got a teaching job in Seattle. I found that the company does not compensate for commute time if you take public transportation. there reasoning is:
- Instructors can spend their public transport time engaging in other activities, unlike if they were in a car. 

Which I hate because its discriminating based on if I can afford a car or not. I currently do not own a car. In there guidelines for getting compensated they always use "commute by car". My thought is, since I ride a bike could I get compensated because I am not able to do other things when riding a bike. I would need the place to be 30 mins away to meet the requirements.
