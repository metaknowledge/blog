# Cliche of Autistic Super-Genius

2024-08-01

In Hollywood there is this cliche of an autistic person who is a genius, usually a math or physics genius. Like Sheldon Cooper (boo) or that guy from the good doctor (also boo). These people do exist in real life, although not as played up as some TV shows or movies show it to be. I have an opinion about how people see these stereotypes. Most people think that the genius comes from them being autistic, like its a genetic trait. While intelligence does have a genetic component, for the most part everyone can learn any knowledge. The only limiting factor for someone to be knowledgeable is putting in the effort. I do believe that anyone can learn a field of mathematics, but most people are not going to benefit from it and therefore will not pursue learning it. Coming back to autism, Autistic people have special interests in thing that give them motivation to learn which makes them smarter. People look at that and think its somehow linked to ASD and not acknowledging the hard work that was put in to get smarter.
