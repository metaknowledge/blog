A todo list if you will, taken from [this blog post](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/). 
1. <s> If you don't have one already, set up a website! You can use any website making tool you want. WordPress, micro.blog, omg.lol are three of many tools that you can use without code or extensive setup. You can even make your own site with code, if you want </s>Note: I used barf
2. Write a blog post about:
3. Something that interests you.
4. Something that brought you joy recently.
5. A thing you learned over the last week.
6. Your thoughts on a book you finished reading.
7. Your strategy on playing a game you like.
8. Or whatever else you would like to write about.
9. Share a recipe you made recently.
10. Publish a photo you took recently.
11. Make a [blogroll](https://indieweb.org/blogroll) that links to personal websites you like.
12. Make a robots.txt file that limits how search engines and AI crawlers can ingest your site.
13. Create a shrine about something that makes you happy (a band, a television show, or anything else).
14. Make an image map that lets someone click on parts of an image to learn more. Perhaps you could make an image map of your desk where someone can click on each object to learn more about it.
15. Share a list of your favourite books.

21. Add a background image to your website or a page on your website.
22. Create a scavenger hunt where people need to hunt through pages to find clues.
23. Leave comments in your HTML so people can understand how different templates on your site work. For example, you could annotate your `head` tag so people looking at the code know what different meta tags do. Remember, someone may be `view-source`ing your website who has never made a website before!
24. Share a list of web pages (articles, websites, blog posts, photos, games, etc.) you have enjoyed recently.
25. Add alt text to images that don't have them.
26. Use WAVE to find potential accessibility issues on different pages on your website.
27. <s>Use PageSpeed Insights to check the speed of your website. Try to make pages load faster if they currently load slow.</s>
	* Rated 99 out of 100 on performance (although there's not a lot of content yet)
