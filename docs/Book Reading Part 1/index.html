<h1>Book Reading Part 1</h1>
<p>2025-07-21
I wanted to read more books since I got a kindle so I compiled a list of books to read. Here is the first part of that list. Spoiler warning</p>
<h2>Brave New World</h2>
<p>88,976 Words
Quick Summary: Everyone is grow as test tube babies. No mothers just straight out of the tube. A single egg is cloned upwards of like a thousand times, and the clones are all given chemicals to edit their body and personality(Including making them dumber). Everyone reveres Henry Ford like a god and even say "Oh Ford" instead of "Oh God". Everyone takes a concoction of drugs called Soma that is told as this perfect happiness pill. Theirs a reservation on the west cost of the united states for native americans. A dude from the "
civilized" society goes and finds a dude, who they call the "Savage", there and takes him out of the reservation and basically parades him around.  Eventually the Savage gets super grossed out and tries to destroy some Soma. Finally the Savage tries to live a life alone in the English countries side. Some people find him whipping himself and a crowd of people rush to see this. He hangs himself at the end.</p>
<p>The book would be good if it didn't advocate for eugenics. There a whole story about how an island is populated with "alphas" and the island could not function because they need more obedient people to do all the work. It just straight up advocates for having distinct social classes were everyone dresses the same based on their class. I shouldn't even be surprised, I knew going into the book that Henry Ford was treated like a god which show the authors ideals.
I think that the idea of Soma could draw parallels to modern day technology use, but it not really worth it. The moral of the story was don't try to be special and conform to society as much as possible. If you can't go live in the woods or on an island.</p>
<h2>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</h2>
<p>136,800 Words
Writing this fresh after reading it. That ending is very pathetic, but the book is very good. I know there is more books in the series apparently, but I am assuming that's it. 
Anyways I found the content of the book to flip flop between very violent and very boring. That first rape of Elisabeth, in my opinion, came out of no where. I guess I should have been expecting it because its a "physiological thriller", but I was reading it on a kindle, and I downloaded it without reading the description.
What I liked was the build up of the mystery of what happened to Harriet. I think when he first found the lead of the photo of Harriet, I was finally happy something had happened. However, now I relies that I the author was really good at building up the characters and environment before everything that happened after. 
Good god was it a long book.
